# 📊 Credit Risk Modelling – WOE & Logistic Regression

## 🔍 Overview
Built a **credit risk scorecard model** to predict loan default using customer demographic and financial data.  
The project follows an industry-standard workflow using **WOE, IV, and Logistic Regression** for an interpretable and regulator-friendly model.
