# 📊 Credit Risk Modelling – WOE & Logistic Regression

##  Overview
Built a **credit risk scorecard model** to predict loan default using customer demographic and financial data.  
The project follows an industry-standard workflow using **WOE, IV, and Logistic Regression** for an interpretable and regulator-friendly model.

---

##  Workflow
- Data cleaning & missing value treatment  
- Risk-based binning (coarse classing)  
- WOE transformation & IV feature selection  
- Multicollinearity check using VIF  
- Logistic Regression model  
- Model validation using **Concordance / Discordance**

---

##  Key Outcomes
- Identified major risk drivers: **Age, Income, Occupation, Housing, Marital Status**  
- Achieved strong ranking power with high concordance  
- Built an **explainable credit scorecard model** aligned with banking practices

---

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Statsmodels
